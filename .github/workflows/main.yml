name: Flow-IPC pipeline

# Discussion on the philosophy behind the workflow (pipeline) below.  The steps themselves should be easy enough to
# follow, but what's the bigger picture?  Answer: The pipeline below is an algorithm, as coded below, invoked
# by GitHub on many runners (machines); and the inputs to this algorithm are:
#   - a branch (`main`, or a feature/PR branch) or tag (usually release tag v<version>);
#     - hence the current contents of that branch/tag;
#   - some trigger event that causes the workflow (pipeline) to run in the first place:
#     push to the branch/tag; pull request (PR) creation; or manual click by human (as of this writing usually
#     for testing or debugging only).
# So given those inputs, what are the outputs or side effects?  To answer, consider what jobs are actually run
# (as parallel as possible).  There's `setup` and `set-vars` as of this writing, but these are
# purely tactical prerequisites and not worth discussing here; once they complete then the "real" jobs will run:
# build-and-test and doc-and-release.  Here are their goals, meaning outputs/side effects given the above
# inputs:
#   - build-and-test:
#     - Summary: Test building and running the product; and bullet-proof it further via run-time sanitizers.
#     - Build the code, including demo/test code, at the given branch/tag in wide variety of compiler/build-type
#       combinations.  The ability to build (including linking into test binaries) successfully is, of course,
#       a test in and of itself.
#     - Test that code by running the available unit test and integration test/demo binaries built in previous bullet.
#       If something fails, help (within reason) make it clear what failed and why.
#       - Output: Make any logs available, whether on success or failure.  If console output is sufficient,
#         great: it'll be visible via GitHub Actions UI.  If not, save the non-console log output in a log tarball
#         available as workflow artifact for download via GitHub Actions UI.
#     - All of the above but with certain run-time sanitizers (as of this writing ASAN/LSAN, UBSAN, TSAN,
#       and possibly clang-MSAN) enabled at build time as well.  (RelWithDebInfo is a sufficient base build type
#       for a sanitizer-enabled build; a subset of compilers -- as opposed to all of them -- is also sufficient
#       for pragmatic reasons.)
#  - doc-and-release:
#    - Summary: 1, generate documentation from the source code (using Doxygen et al) and make it conveniently
#      available.  2, update GitHub Release and GitHub Pages web site automatically with any relevant info, namely
#      with the generated docs and source code tarball/zip.
#    - Generate the documentation using Doxygen et al.  The goal here is the *canonical generated documentation*, not
#      *testing the ability to generate it*.  It's a subtle difference, but it's important to note it, because
#      if we wanted to test the ins and outs of doc generation in various environments then we could have a much more
#      complex and longer pipeline -- and perhaps we should... but that's not the goal *here*.
#      - Output: Make it available as workflow artifact for download via GitHub Actions UI.
#        Hence human can simply download it, whether it's for the `main` tip or a specific release version.
#      - Side effect: (On pushes/merges to `main` branch *only*) Check-in the *generated docs* back into `main`
#        itself, so that (1) they're available for local perusal by any person cloning/pulling `main` and (2) ditto
#        for any downstream releases (which are mere tags of `main`).
#        - Side effect: Having done so, signal GitHub Pages web site for the org, so that the new `main` docs
#          are reflected at this web site.  (It'll automatically clone `main`, copy the generated docs to web site
#          replacing the existing `main` docs if any, and stage this to the web.)
#    - (If the branch/tag input is, in fact, tag v* -- a release tag) The mere fact that a push to a release tag X
#      is being observed means we want:
#      - Side effect: Ensure that the GitHub Release X has the full source code available for human download
#        as a package (tarball/zip).  I.e., upload it there as needed.
#      - Side effect: Ensure that the GitHub Pages web site actually lists this Release and its associated
#        generated documentation.  I.e., signal Pages that there's a Release X now: it'll then do the right
#        thing (namely checkout the docs at the tag and copy them over; and add a link to the release and docs
#        in the appropriate web page).
#
# So, roughly speaking,
#   - build-and-test is about building and testing the product, including bullet-proofing it with sanitizers.
#   - doc-and-release is about official documentation-based-on-source being available in various customary ways;
#     with a side of official releases being accessible and comprehensively presented in customary ways.
#     - TODO: It *could* be argued that those 2 goals are related but separate, and perhaps they should be 2 separate
#       jobs.  However, at least as of this writing, there's definite overlap between them, and combining the 2
#       makes pragmatic sense.  It's worth revisiting periodically perhaps.

  # in case the source change adds a Doxygen error or bad-looking docs).  Note this runs on PR creation *and* update.

    branches:

  push:
    # Was able to merge PR to `main` tip?  Should ensure these builds/tests/doc generation still pass after the fact
    # (post-merge `main` does not always equal the PR-branch state); plus:
    # auto-check-in generated docs into `main` branch tip (and signal web site to update accordingly).
    branches:
      - main
    # Created release tag?  Just in case, should ensure these builds/tests pass (just in case, but it's redundant
    # against the branch=main trigger above); generate docs and make them available as artifact (nice: docs for
    # a particular product version available online); plus:
    # signal web site to update accordingly (there's probably a new release to present, with full source code attached;
    # and there are docs for it; nice: docs for a particular product version available online).

        # We concentrate on clang sanitizers; they are newer/nicer; also MSAN is clang-only.  So gcc ones excluded.
        # Attention!  Excluding some sanitizer job(s) (with these reasons):
        #   - MSAN: MSAN protects against reads of uninitialized memory; it is clang-only (not gcc), unlike the other
        #     *SAN.  Its mission overlaps at least partially with UBSAN's; for example for sure there were a couple of
        #     uninitialized reads in test code which UBSAN caught.  Its current state -- if not excluded -- is as
        #     follows: 1, due to (as of this writing) building dependencies, including the capnp compiler binary used
        #     during our build process, with the same compiler build config as the real code, ignore-list entires had
        #     to be added to get past these problems.  2, before main() in *all* our demos/tests Boost was doing some
        #     global init which MSAN did not like and hence aborted before main(); these are now ignored as well.
        #     3, this got us into main() at least, but immediately cryptic aborts started, seemingly again originating
        #     in Boost (but requires detailed investigation to really understand).  At this point I (ygoldfel)
        #     disabled MSAN and filed a ticket.  The overall status: MSAN is said to be useful, even with UBSAN active,
        #     but all resources including official docs indicate that it is a high-maintenance tool:
        #     *All* linked code, including libc and libstdc++/libc++ (the former in our case as of this writing),
        #     must be instrumented to avoid cryptic false positives.  The good news is we do build other things
        #     instrumented (Boost libs, jemalloc, capnp/kj, gtest); but not libstdc++ (which official docs recommend);
        #     this can be done but requires more work (I would suggest switching to libc++ in that case from the
        #     start, as the clang people made it and themselves build it instrumented for their testing).
        #     So the bottom line: MSAN is a tough cookie and requires more work before enabling.  In the meantime we
        #     have many layers of protection, including ASAN and UBSAN and lots of unit and integration tests.
        #     So this status quo is pretty good.  TODO: Do the work/get MSAN functional/useful; un-exclude it then.
        #   - *SAN with gcc: We concentrate on clang sanitizers; they are newer/nicer; having to worry about differences
        #     between them is an excessive burden.  So excluding gcc ASAN/UBSAN/TSAN.
        #     - TODO: Consider reducing to the newest or most stable clang.  Generally they just keep improving; the
        #       chances of something being uncaught (incorrectly) with a later version are slim.  Not impossible though.
        #       Look into it.  Update: As of this writing transport_test exercise mode/SHM-jemalloc sub-mode is
        #       disabled for TSAN clang-17 due to instability of TSAN itself.  So clearly when it comes to TSAN
        #       (which is officially in beta as of clang-17), higher version does not mean everything is better.
        #       Hence perhaps this to-do is more of a longer-term thing, when all the sanitizers stabilize, or when
        #       we find a single very-stable config.  Just remember we aren't testing the sanitizer or our code's
        #       ability to be sanitized; we just want to detect any problems in the code -- however we get there.
        #   - *SAN with clang-13 (but not 15+): As of this writing clang-13 produces some additional warnings,
        #     at least in TSAN, which appear to be related to nearby non-race messages like
        #     `==75454==WARNING: Symbolizer buffer too small`.  As a result, we either have to eliminate the
        #     latter problem (TODO: look into it) or suppress false-positive race warnings that might only look
        #     like added problems due to the incomplete stack traces.  In general scanning through clang-13-produced
        #     TSAN output, there is a chaotic feel to it, when it comes to stack output.  Meanwhile so far
        #     there has been zero evidence that a lower-version clang has actual added problems versus the other
        #     compiler-versions, due to generating code differently.  Since we have at least 3 other compiler-versions
        #     running all the *SAN, I (ygoldfel) decided to exclude clang-13 *SAN, until the chaotic *SAN messages can
        #     be at least reduced.  In the meantime our *SAN coverage is still quite good.

    # (capnp compiler binary; temp binaries created by auto-tools configure scripts to test features).
    # In the case of the libs that's usually good; in particular things like
    # -fsanitize=address (ASAN) (for build-type relwithdebinfo-asan) ideally are applied to all built code
    # uniformly.  (There are other libs being built, one can see: at least openssl and zlib; they're not really
    # involved in our actual product, at least not in a core way, so for those it arguably matters less either way.)
    # In the case of the binaries it is usually bad; we want the fastest, most normal tools possible, not ones
    # built weirdly with whatever settings we're trying to test with our own software.  For one it makes those
    # tools slower -- perhaps not the hugest deal in practice here -- but it also generally increases entropy; and
    # it has also resulted in various pain:
    #   - Cannot use -fno-sanitize-recover with UBSAN (abort program on warning) if we wanted to: it causes some
    #     hidden configure-script-generated binary abort => capnp binary build fails.
    #   - capnp binary fails MSAN at startup; hence capnp-compilation of our .capnp schemas fails.
    # We have worked around all these, so the thing altogether works.  It's just somewhat odd and entropy-ridden;
    # and might cause maintainability problems over time, as it has already in the past.
    # The TODO is to be more judicious about it
    # and only apply these things to the libs/executables we want it applied.  It is probably not so simple;
    # but worst-case it should be possible to use something like build-type-cflags-override to target our code;
    # and per-recipe (Boost, jemalloc, gtest...) techniques to target others; and not use the aggressive
    # conan-profile-custom-conf and conan-profile-custom-buildenv.  That said, there will be interesting subtleties
    # like: libcapnp/kj are linked into capnp compiler binary; *and* to our code.  So we should instrument it with
    # sanitizer (when applicable); now some of the capnp-compiler-binary is instrumented; some isn't.  Would that
    # work, or would it be better to build capnp twice then (once for the binary, once for the linked libraries)?

    # We need to prepare a sanitizer ignore-list in MSAN mode.  Background for this is subtle and annoying:
    # As it stands, whatever matrix compiler/build-type is chosen applies not just to our code (correct)
    # and 3rd party libraries we link like lib{boost_*|capnp|kj|jemalloc} (semi-optional but good) but also
    # unfortunately any items built from source during "Install Flow-IPC dependencies" step that we then
    # use during the build step for our own code subsequently.  At a minimum this will slow down
    # such programs.  (For the time being we accept this as not-so-bad; to target this config at some things
    # but not others is hard/a ticket.)  In particular, though, the capnp compiler binary is built this way;
    # and our "Build targets" step uses it to build key things (namely convert .capnp schemas into .c++
    # and .h sources which are then themselves compiled/used in compilation).  In the case of MSAN, this
    # version of capnp compiler happens to trigger several MSAN failures (presumably they are not a true
    # problem, and it's not our job really to sanitize capnp -- though we can file tickets for them and/or
    # issue PRs; but I digress).  So in MSAN mode our build step fails, when capnp compiler itself aborts
    # with MSAN failures.  One approach is to not apply MSAN to capnp compiler (no-go for now; it's a ticket
    # as mentioned); another is to uses Conan to patch capnp package for them (not a bad idea; ticket filed);

    # to begin-with, this is a no-brainer.  For those (as of this writing the main one
    # is unit_test; but also the link tests produce short logs too) who use stdout/stderr
    # the reason to do this is 2-fold.
    #   - UBSAN in particular produces non-fatal error output about problems it detects.
    #     We need to analyze them after the fact and fail a step below in that case to
    #     alert developers who would then fix such new problems.
    #     - One can also build UBSAN-mode things with -fno-sanitize-recover which would
    #       cause abnormal program exit on *first* error.  We do not do this for these
    #       reasons:
    #       - It is more convenient to let it continue and thus show all problems in one
    #         shot.
    #       - There is a side problem: At this time compile settings, including
    #         in UBSAN case `-fsanitize=undefined -fno-sanitize-recover`, are applied not
    #         just to our code or 3rd party libraries but also any other stuff built
    #         (due to setting C[XX]FLAGS in Conan profile).  Targeting just the exact
    #         stuff we want with those is hard and a separate project/ticket.
    #         In the meantime -fno-sanitize-recover causes completely unrelated program
    #         halts during the very-early step, when building dependencies including
    #         capnp; some autotools configure.sh fails crazily, and nothing can work
    #         from that point on due to dependencies-install step failing.  So at this
    #         time -fno-sanitize-recover is a no-go; it affects too much unrelated stuff.
    #   - It is more consistent/convenient to get all the bulky logs in one place as an
    #     artifact, rather than some in the pipeline output, others in the artifacts.
    #     (This preference is subjective, yes.)

    # Here, as in all other tests below, we assemble a suppressions file in case this is a sanitized
    # run; and we follow the procedure explained near setup-tests-env definition.  To reiterate: to avoid
    # tedium, but at the cost of maintainability of this file (meaning if a suppressions context is added then
    # a few lines would need to be added here), we only list those contexts where *any* sanitizer has
    # *any* suppression; otherwise we skip it for brevity.  `find . -name 'suppressions*.cfg` is pretty useful
    # to determine their presence in addition to whether the test itself has its specific suppressions of any kind.

    # We want a source tarball and/or zip to be attached to the Release.  Delightfully, GitHub does this
    # automatically.  Less delightfully, we have submodules -- where most of the code is in fact -- which GitHub
    # will not include (they'll just be empty dirs instead).  So we create and upload a tarball, etc., manually.
    # (It is not, from what we can tell, possible to then delete the auto-attached "Source code" archives; they
    # are not listable/deletable/uploadable assets in the same way but a built-in GitHub thing.  Hopefully there
    # will be no issue.)
    #
    # Regarding the actual upload request (x2): We do it via curl, following the documented GitHub API.
    # Some resources recommend doing this (x2) instead:
    #   uses: actions/upload-release-asset@v1.0.2
    #   env:
    #     GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    #   with:
    #     upload_url: ${{ steps.prep_release_pkgs.outputs.upload-url }}
    #     asset_path: ${{ github.workspace }}/../${{ steps.prep_release_pkgs.outputs.tgz-name }}
    #     asset_name: ${{ steps.prep_release_pkgs.outputs.tgz-name }}
    #     asset_content_type: application/gzip
    # For me (ygoldfel), despite a few hours of trying this and that and attempting to get debug output, it kept
    # yielding `Invalid name for request` error with no added info.  Reasons might be: some silly error on my part
    # (but it is very vanilla, and I reduced it down to the bare essentials with no success, while also eliminating
    # possibilities like it being unable to find the local file to upload and other stupidities); a change in API
    # or some other behavior that was not handled by the upload-release-asset action package; possibly a break
    # in a dependency of upload-release-asset (octokat?).  upload-release-asset was last updated in 2020 and is
    # officially now unmaintained.  So I fought valiantly but eventually moved onto just using curl which worked
    # almost immediately.  Since the resulting code isn't even longer, and we are using a documented public API and
    # standard tool (curl) which we also use elsewhere, it seemed a reasonable approach.  TODO: Revisit perhaps.
