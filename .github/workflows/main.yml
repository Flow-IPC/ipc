        # We concentrate on clang sanitizers; they are newer/nicer; also MSAN is clang-only.  So gcc ones excluded.
        # Attention!  Excluding some sanitizer job(s) (with these reasons):
        #   - MSAN: MSAN protects against reads of ununitialized memory; it is clang-only (not gcc), unlike the other
        #     *SAN.  Its mission overlaps at least partially with UBSAN's; for example for sure there were a couple of
        #     uninitialized reads in test code which UBSAN caught.  Its current state -- if not excluded -- is as
        #     follows: 1, due to (as of this writing) building dependencies, including the capnp compiler binary used
        #     during our build process, with the same compiler build config as the real code, ignore-list entires had
        #     to be added to get past these problems.  2, before main() in *all* our demos/tests Boost was doing some
        #     global init which MSAN did not like and hence aborted before main(); these are now ignored as well.
        #     3, this got us into main() at least, but immediately cryptic aborts started, seemingly again originating
        #     in Boost (but requires detailed investigation to really understand).  At this point I (ygoldfel)
        #     disabled MSAN and filed a ticket.  The overall status: MSAN is said to be useful, even with UBSAN active,
        #     but all resources including official docs indicate that it is a high-maintenance tool:
        #     *All* linked code, including libc and libstdc++/libc++ (the former in our case as of this writing),
        #     must be instrumented to avoid cryptic false positives.  The good news is we do build other things
        #     instrumented (Boost libs, jemalloc, capnp/kj, gtest); but not libstdc++ (which official docs recommend);
        #     this can be done but requires more work (I would suggest switching to libc++ in that case from the
        #     start, as the clang people made it and themselves build it instrumented for their testing).
        #     So the bottom line: MSAN is a tough cookie and requires more work before enabling.  In the meantime we
        #     have many layers of protection, including ASAN and UBSAN and lots of unit and integration tests.
        #     So this status quo is pretty good.  TODO: Do the work/get MSAN functional/useful; un-exclude it then.
        #   - *SAN with gcc: We concentrate on clang sanitizers; they are newer/nicer; having to worry about differences
        #     between them is an excessive burden.  So excluding gcc ASAN/UBSAN/TSAN.
        #     - TODO: Consider reducing to the newest or most stable clang.  Generally they just keep improving; the
        #       chances of something being uncaught (incorrectly) with a later version are slim.  Not impossible though.
        #       Look into it.  Update: As of this writing transport_test exercise mode/SHM-jemalloc sub-mode is
        #       disabled for TSAN clang-17 due to instability of TSAN itself.  So clearly when it comes to TSAN
        #       (which is officially in beta as of clang-17), higher version does not mean everything is better.
        #       Hence perhaps this to-do is more of a longer-term thing, when all the sanitizers stabilize, or when
        #       we find a single very-stable config.  Just remember we aren't testing the sanitizer or our code's
        #       ability to be sanitized; we just want to detect any problems in the code -- however we get there.
        #   - *SAN with clang-13 (but not 15+): As of this writing clang-13 produces some additional warnings,
        #     at least in TSAN, which appear to be related to nearby non-race messages like
        #     `==75454==WARNING: Symbolizer buffer too small`.  As a result, we either have to eliminate the
        #     latter problem (TODO: look into it) or suppress false-positive race warnings that might only look
        #     like added problems due to the incomplete stack traces.  In general scanning through clang-13-produced
        #     TSAN output, there is a chaotic feel to it, when it comes to stack output.  Meanwhile so far
        #     there has been zero evidence that a lower-version clang has actual added problems versus the other
        #     compiler-versions, due to generating code differently.  Since we have at least 3 other compiler-versions
        #     running all the *SAN, I (ygoldfel) decided to exclude clang-13 *SAN, until the chaotic *SAN messages can
        #     be at least reduced.  In the meantime our *SAN coverage is still quite good.

    # (capnp compiler binary; temp binaries created by auto-tools configure scripts to test features).
    # In the case of the libs that's usually good; in particular things like
    # -fsanitize=address (ASAN) (for build-type relwithdebinfo-asan) ideally are applied to all built code
    # uniformly.  (There are other libs being built, one can see: at least openssl and zlib; they're not really
    # involved in our actual product, at least not in a core way, so for those it arguably matters less either way.)
    # In the case of the binaries it is usually bad; we want the fastest, most normal tools possible, not ones
    # built weirdly with whatever settings we're trying to test with our own software.  For one it makes those
    # tools slower -- perhaps not the hugest deal in practice here -- but it also generally increases entropy; and
    # it has also resulted in various pain:
    #   - Cannot use -fno-sanitize-recover with UBSAN (abort program on warning) if we wanted to: it causes some
    #     hidden configure-script-generated binary abort => capnp binary build fails.
    #   - capnp binary fails MSAN at startup; hence capnp-compilation of our .capnp schemas fails.
    # We have worked around all these, so the thing altogether works.  It's just somewhat odd and entropy-ridden;
    # and might cause maintanability problems over time, as it has already in the past.
    # The TODO is to be more judicious about it
    # and only apply these things to the libs/executables we want it applied.  It is probably not so simple;
    # but worst-case it should be possible to use something like build-type-cflags-override to target our code;
    # and per-recipe (Boost, jemalloc, gtest...) techniques to target others; and not use the aggressive
    # conan-profile-custom-conf and conan-profile-custom-buildenv.  That said, there will be interesting subtleties
    # like: libcapnp/kj are linked into capnp compiler binary; *and* to our code.  So we should instrument it with
    # sanitizer (when applicable); now some of the capnp-compiler-binary is instrumented; some isn't.  Would that
    # work, or would it be better to build capnp twice then (once for the binary, once for the linked libraries)?

    # but not others is hard/a ticket.)  In particular, though, the capnp compiler binary is built this way;
    # and our "Build targets" step uses it to build key things (namely convert .capnp schemas into .c++
    # and .h sources which are then themselves compiled/used in compilation).  In the case of MSAN, this

    # is unit_test; but also the link tests produce short logs too) who use stdout/stderr
    # the reason to do this is 2-fold.
    #   - UBSAN in particular produces non-fatal error output about problems it detects.
    #     We need to analyze them after the fact and fail a step below in that case to
    #     alert developers who would then fix such new problems.
    #     - One can also build UBSAN-mode things with -fno-sanitize-recover which would
    #       cause abnormal program exit on *first* error.  We do not do this for these
    #       reasons:
    #       - It is more convenient to let it continue and thus show all problems in one
    #         shot.
    #       - There is a side problem: At this time compile settings, including
    #         in UBSAN case `-fsanitize=undefined -fno-sanitize-recover`, are applied not
    #         just to our code or 3rd party libraries but also any other stuff built
    #         (due to setting C[XX]FLAGS in Conan profile).  Targeting just the exact
    #         stuff we want with those is hard and a separate project/ticket.
    #         In the meantime -fno-sanitize-recover causes completely unrealted program
    #         halts during the very-early step, when building dependencies including
    #         capnp; some autotools configure.sh fails crazily, and nothing can work
    #         from that point on due to dependencies-install step failing.  So at this
    #         time -fno-sanitize-recover is a no-go; it affects too much unrelated stuff.
    #   - It is more consistent/convenient to get all the bulky logs in one place as an
    #     artifact, rather than some in the pipeline output, others in the artifacts.
    #     (This preference is subjective, yes.)

    # Here, as in all other tests below, we assemble a suppressions file in case this is a sanitized
    # run; and we follow the procedure explained near setup-tests-env definition.  To reiterate: to avoid
    # tedium, but at the cost of mantainability of this file (meaning if a suppressions context is added then
    # a few lines would need to be added here), we only list those contexts where *any* sanitizer has
    # *any* suppression; otherwise we skip it for brevity.  `find . -name 'suppressions*.cfg` is pretty useful
    # to determine their presence in addition to whether the test itself has its specific suppressions of any kind.

    # any failing step is repeated with logging hiked up.  Note that formally (and practically)
    # higher-than-INFO verbosity is allowed to affect performance and thus is *not* right for
    # the main integration test run.  However on failure all bets are off, and we just want the
    # info we can get.  (Also higher-verbosity runs can take significantly longer; no one wants that.)
    #
    # As of this writing unit_test already runs with high verbosity, so we do not re-run on failure
    # like these.  The `link_test`s above are very basic tests, essentially there to ensure all built okay
    # and run a sanity-check of a core feature of each of ours libs; so no re-run on failure there either.
