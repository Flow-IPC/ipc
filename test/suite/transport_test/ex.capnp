  # Guy (cli or srv) filling-out the metadata, say, sets this to # of init-channels the *recipient* will want opened
  # on its behalf.  This is contrived and only for demo purposes; so in our apps we just, like, assert this value is
  # consistent with that.  E.g., client will say "you want 3 init-channels" and then server will go,
  # "ah yes, indeed I was gonna open 3 init-channels."


  autoPing @3: Bool;

### struc::Channel type A schema.

    # mess up ordering); plus optionally a Native_handle which is the write-end of a pipe into which recipient
    # will write the ID to be checked by the sender.
  }

  description @3 :Text;
  # Demonstrates that, if desired, every message (despite the union requirement) can come with a common thing too.
  # Thanks, capnp!  Anyway we can stuff a description of the test here; self-documentation of sorts.

### struc::Channel type B schema.
# It's similar but slightly different, just to show it can be different -- it's not working by coincidence.
# It's arbitrary how to differentiate them, but for fun we'll replace the possibly-big List(Text) (capnp-native

  # Length sum in stringBlobListDirect must equal this.  Sender will send large payloads;

  # send a SHM handle).

  sessionLendElseArenaLend @3 :Bool;
  # When invoking lend_object() and borrow_object(), one can do it via
  # Session::lend_object()/borrow_object() or via Arena::lend_object()/borrow_object();
  # these must be mutually consistent.  (Internally in the former case (which is arguably easier to use, depending),
  # to make it work, Session must determine which Arena the lent handle is from -- app_shm() or session_shm() --
  # and encode that into the serialization blob, so that internally Session::borrow_object() can figure out which
  # internally-stored Arena::borrow_object() it must forward-to.  That's the case for SHM-classic.
  # With SHM-jemalloc it's a direct forward on both sides: to Jemalloc Shm_session lend_object() and borrow_object()
  # respectively.  Though we can still invoke the wrapper in Session or directly via Shm_session.)
  #
  # This Bool indicates to the receiver which borrow/lend_object() API is being tested; true means the Session
  # one; otherwise the Arena (SHM-classic) or Session (SHM-jemalloc).

  omitHandleRead @4 :Bool;
  # Iff true, *ignore* stringBlobListDirect (which is <whatever>, but no lend_object() was called) -- instead
  # check the STL data structure saved from the last message; its contents nevertheless should match
  # cumulativeSz.  It tests in-place modification without re-borrow/lend_object().
