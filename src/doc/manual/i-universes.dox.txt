This page concerns advanced high-level situations wherein three or more applications are engaging in IPC; that is at least one application talks to at least two other applications.  So far we've limited discussion to a server application Ap talking to a client application Bp (Ap-Bp split) while merely mentioning that, e.g., Ap could also be talking to client Cp (Ap-Cp split).  It can get fancier: Ap could be server in Ap-Bp split while being the *client* in a Cp-Ap split.  From there, it can grow as complex as you need it to be.

(Or go back to preceding page: @ref safety_perms.  @ref session_setup, particularly the parts about the ipc::session::App hierarchy, would also be a natural immediate pre-requisite for the current page.)

This page is under construction; it is referred-to but not yet written.

The next page is: @ref chan_struct.
